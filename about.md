Lean Logics team consists of professional Ruby on Rails developers carefully selected on the Lesser Poland market, mainly form Cracow. 
For body leasing service we dedicate only software engineers with extensive experience (at least 4 years of real life project experience).
 
The working time and competences are efficiently fulfilled with the support of the team. You don’t worry about sick-leaves, vacations, labor law, sourcing, contract termination, motivation, working environment etc. You pay only per efficient hour of development work.
 
Our approach to the project consist of TDD and SCRUM. We often develop in pairs. We believe that front-end developer and back-end developers shall be a separate specialists.                                                                                                                          
Very often we blend the border between our team and our your team (clause against hiring employs is required). This results not only in better communication but also in knowledge and experiences exchange. We insist on a good contact with customer during remote work and suggest daily verbal catch-ups or working on customers side.
 
By default we develop with the use of our own programing environment but working on our client’s stuff is also possible.
 
Engineers are skilled in Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, Node.js, jQuery, Django, Tornado, MongoDB, RabbitMQ and developing web applications in vanilla JavaScript. Ensured skills came always form lead roles in development of real working webservices and real working server solutions.
